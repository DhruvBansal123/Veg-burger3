Step 1:-
To make the burger patty, pressure cook the carrot, peas and sweet corn for 1 whistle or until soft.

Step 2
Add the cooked vegetables, chopped onions, red chilli powder, lemon juice, garam masala powder, salt and ginger-garlic paste to a large bowl.

Step 3
Add lemon juice and mashed potatoes in the bowl, mix well until evenly combined. Shape the mixture into small/medium patties.

Step 4
Now heat oil in a pan over medium flame. Roll the prepared patties in the breadcrumbs and shallow fry until golden brown on both sides.

Step 5
Remove and keep aside.

Step 6
Take one half of the burger bun. Spread some butter and place the lettuce on top.

Step 7
Place the prepared vegetable patty on top. Top up with slices of onion, tomato, cucumber and cheese. If you want to make it even more delicious and healthy replace cheese with eggless mayonnaise.

Step 8
Cover it with the other half of the burger bun. If desired, add some ketchup on top. Secure it with a toothpick if desired.
